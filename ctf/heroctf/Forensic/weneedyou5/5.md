# We need you 5/5

The url & username was :

http://nemesis3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion & Razex everybody found it with the iehistory

For the password it was a little bit tricky:

You have to dump the process of the PID 3504 (which correspond to iexplorer.exe).

Then, we've my hint :
Even if he is a very good hacker, he doesn't apply all the right principles, especially when it comes to passwords. 

P.S.: No bruteforce needed, just think about the "stupid things" people do when they create passwords.

We have to search with informations we have on the hacker:
Razex - Ruben PAVOLI - Dany GOLDEN

With Ruben PAVOLI and Dany GOLDEN, we didn't found anything that can deal with a password.

One last trick : In web browser, credentials in the memory aren't stored in UTF-8 format, but in UTF-16, so you have to use the option "-el" of strings :

```strings -el 3504.dmp | grep -i "razex"```

Parsing the results a bit and removing the duplicates, we end up with :
```
-RAZEX
.\Razex
\Razex
Razex
Razex@
"Razex\Ap
Razex.bmpmp
Razex.dat
-RazexKannibal
RazexKannibal
razexP85Inq4
RAZEXrn
rRazex
rs\Razex
```

razexP85Inq4 was his password.
