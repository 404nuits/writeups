# Back to the past

## Part 1

**Synopsis :** A math teacher was recently fired from his high school and the principal is worried about what he might do.
We are asked to search about this teacher whose name is Jacque Houzit

### Linkedin

With a search on Google, we found that he has a LinkedIn account

On his profile page, we can see that he has a contact form, with a link to his github account

### Github

If we look a bit, we can see a **Preparation** subfolder in the **Hacking** folder

In this folder, there is a link to a pastebin with the note "For Archangel"

On the pastebin, there is only 1 paste named "back to the past", which is locked by a password

With the hint in the name, we can try to use the [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/) to see older versions of the page

We can then see that there are 2 snapshots on 6th and 8th feb 2021

On those snapshots, there is a new paste called "Password", with the password in it

Then, we try this password on the other paste and bingo, we have the flag with a hint for the 2nd part
